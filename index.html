        <h3>Biography</h3>

        <p>About me.  I am originally from Bogalusa, Louisiana(small town about 40 miles north of <b>New Orleans</b>).  I lived there until I was about 12 when we moved to <i>Houston, Texas</i> where my Dad got a job with Texas Instruments.  We moved to Waller, Texas where I finished high school and went on to join the Navy.  I <ins>was</ins> in the Navy for 20 years achieving the rank of <strong>Cheif Petty Officer</strong>.  I have been to over 30 countries around the world and have been around the tip of Africa and the tip of South America.  I then went on to work for the San Diego Superior Court for 10 years in the IT department where I studied and obtained my BS in Software Development from Coleman University. Currently I work for a company remotley that is in <ins>Austin, Texas</ins>.  I am hoping that with this course that I can become a Full Stack Developer and perform work for either a company that I work on my own schedule or a <sub>free lance developer</sub>.  Another option is to possble start my own <sup>buiness</sup> and hire other developers.   </p>
        

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            For me I have a bunch of "hobbies" I like to do. I own a 1967 Ford Mustang that I'm currently restoring.   I enjoy online gaming, and the game of choice is BattleField 4.  I enjoy working on my house, i.e. painting, gardening, building new things around my house.  I enjoy going to the movies, going for a long drive (decided to go to Vegas at 11 am on a Sunday and was back around 2 am the next morning.).
